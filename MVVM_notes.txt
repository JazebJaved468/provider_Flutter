MVVM architecture has following layers: 
- Model
- View
- View Model
- Service
- Repository
- Data Source

Project Setup:

Install Following packages:
- package: fluttertoast
- package: http
- package: another_flushbar
- package: provider

Folder Structure: (dir = folder , f = file)

    lib
        view 
        view_model
        model
        data
            network
            response
            app_exceptions.dart
        repository
        res
        utils

view_model : implements logic
view : only UI
model : parse data to use in our app
utils : repeatedly used stuff
repository : link between network layer logic layer, repository sends response to view_model
res (resources) : colors, constant values, components, urls
data : managed stuff related to networking, also handling exceptions or errors in api



Solid Principles: make one class for only one functionality that can easily be modifiable.
