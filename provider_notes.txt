Roadmap
- stateless and stateful widgets
- Conventional Method - setState()
- why to learn state mgt
- Provider State Management
- single Provider
- multi Provider
- change notifier
- value listener


stateless widgets
- are immutable
- can't change its state
- variable declared final can't change its value during run time, like on pressing button or some other action
- used with widgets that user don't interact with 
- uses less memory as they build only once
- Problem: we can update data but can't rebuild UI and update data on UI.

stateful widgets
- are mutable
- use setState() : rebuilds UI/view
- problem :
    - rebuilds the whole view(UI/widget) even those widgets whose state didn't even change.
    - performance isseus if that view contain alot of widgets that don't need to be rebuild.

Why need to learn Provider or any other state management
- to rebuild only those widgets in which data is being changed and not the whole view in which  that reactive widget is used.
